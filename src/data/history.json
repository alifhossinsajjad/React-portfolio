      "My Journey as a Full-Stack Developer",
      "RI’ve been on a dedicated path to becoming a full-stack developer for the past four years. My journey began with a strong interest in how websites and applications work, which led me to dive deep into both front-end and back-end technologies. Over time, I honed my skills in languages like JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and frameworks like React.js, Next.js, and Node.js.",
      "Throughout my studies, I’ve focused on building real-world applications, from simple static websites to complex, dynamic web apps. I love the challenge of taking an idea from concept to code, turning problems into solutions through innovation. This hands-on experience in creating and deploying websites has given me a solid foundation, even though I haven’t worked in a professional environment yet.",
      "I’m passionate about creating clean, efficient, and scalable code, and my portfolio is a reflection of that. Every project I've worked on has helped me grow, and I’m excited about continuing my development journey, whether it’s contributing to open-source projects, collaborating with other developers, or eventually joining a professional team."
